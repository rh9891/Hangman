## Description

Hangman is a mobile-responsive game application where you type in a letter with the objective of figuring out the hidden word given a set amount of guesses. The application features a hangman pole and figure using custom SVG.

## User Story

```
AS A player
I WANT to type in letters
SO THAT I can correctly guess the randomly generated word.
```

## Features of the Application

```
GIVEN a hangman game application
WHEN I access the landing page
THEN I will see a hangman pole displayed (using SVG) and a randomly generated word in blanks.

WHEN I guess a letter correctly
THEN I will see the letter filled in the respective blanks.

WHEN I guess a letter incorrectly
THEN I will see the wrong letter displayed in the UI.

WHEN I guess a letter incorrectly
THEN I will see a new part of the hangman figure.

WHEN I guess the same letter twice
THEN I will get a notification that I have already guessed that letter.

WHEN I have either won or lost the game
THEN I will see a "Play Again" button to reset the game.
